# MissionDemolition
One of the projects I completed in my free time. It was created using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and Unity Hub. It also utilizes the coding language of C#. It is meant to have aspects similar to that of [Angry Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds), [Crossbows and Catapults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbows_and_Catapults), [Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(series)), and [Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)). I also used this [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Game-Design-Prototyping-Development/dp/0134659864) for aspects of the code and assets. If you are curious about the various assets and prefabs that I used make sure to check out the [License.txt](https://github.com/Juniperistic/MissionDemolition/blob/main/_Scripts/License.txt). Once it is completed and released it will be found on [its Itch.io Page](https://juniperistic.itch.io/mission-demolition).
